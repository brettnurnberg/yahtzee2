Yahtzee Use Cases

1. Starting a game
    The yahtzee scorecard is set with all options unselected
    and all scores at 0. The dice are all reset to 1 and the roll
    count is reset.

2. Playing a game
    The player rolls the dice. The player selects the dice that he
    wants to keep. If he wants to score the dice, he selects the
    category to score, and the corresponding score is calculated
    and displayed. This process is repeated twice more, and after
    the third roll, the player must score the roll.

3. Ending a game
    Once all scoring categories have been filled, the final score
    of the game is displayed. If the player has achieved a new
    high score, he will be prompted for his name.
